<h2>HOLLYBROOK HALL, COUNTY OF WICKLOW.</h2>

<p>Among the very many beautiful residences of our nobility and
gentry, situated within a drive of an hour or two of our metropolis,
there is probably not one better worthy of a visit than
that which we have chosen to depict as the illustration of our
present number&mdash;Hollybrook Hall, the seat of Sir George
Frederick John Hodson, Bart. It is situated in the county
of Wicklow, about a mile beyond the town of Bray, and about
eleven miles from Dublin.</p>

<p>To direct public attention to this charming spot is no less
our pleasure than our duty, for we feel quite assured that
even among the higher classes of our fellow-citizens but a very
few know more respecting it than its name and locality, and
that it will surprise the vast majority to be told that Hollybrook
Hall is no less remarkable for the beauty of the sylvan
scenery by which it is surrounded, than as affording in itself the
most perfect specimen of the Tudor style of architecture to
be found in Ireland.</p>

<p>That Hollybrook is thus little known to the public, is not,
however, their fault: excluded from the eye by high and unsightly
stone walls on every side by which it might otherwise
be seen by the traveller, it is passed without even a glimpse
of the bower of beauty, which would attract his attention and
excite the desire to obtain a more intimate acquaintance with
objects of such interest by a request to its accomplished
owner, which we are satisfied would never be denied.</p>

<p>Hollybrook Hall, like Clontarf Castle, of which we have
already given some account, is a fine specimen of the many
recently erected or rebuilt residences of our nobility and gentry,
which we esteem it our duty to notice and to praise.
Like that fine structure also, it is an architectural creation of
that accomplished artist to whose exquisite taste and correct
judgment we are indebted for so many of the most beautiful
buildings in the kingdom; and in many of its features and
the general arrangement of its parts, it bears a considerable
resemblance to that admirably composed edifice. In its
ground plan and general outline, however, it is essentially
different; and it is, moreover, characterised by a peculiarity
which perhaps no other of Mr Morrison’s works exhibits,
namely, that it has no mixed character of style, but is
in every respect an example of English domestic architecture
in the style of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, or, in other
words, it uniformly preserves through all its details the character
of the Tudor style.</p>

<p>In the choice of this style, as well as in the general composition
of the structure, the artist was obviously guided by a judicious
desire to adapt the building to the peculiar character of
the scenery by which it is surrounded, and the historical
associations connected with the locality; and a more happy
result than that which he has effected could hardly be imagined.
Seated upon a green and sunny terraced bank in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
midst of venerable yew and other evergreens, and immediately
above a small artificial lake or pond, which reflects on
its surface the dark masses of ancient and magnificent forest
trees, which rise on all sides from its banks, and which are
only topped by the peaked summits of the greater and lesser
Sugar-Loaf Mountains, as seen through vistas, the building
and its immediate accompaniments seem of coequal age and
designed for each other; and all breathe of seclusion from the
cares of the world and a happy domestic repose. It would
indeed be impossible to conceive any combinations of architecture
and landscape scenery more perfectly harmonious or
beautiful of their kind.</p>

<p>Hollybrook Hall is wholly built of mountain granite squared
and chiselled, and presents three architectural fronts. That
which we have represented in our illustration is the east front,
which faces the small lake or pond, and contains the library
and drawing-room; but the principal front is that facing the
north, on which side the entrance porch is placed. The principal
apartments consist of a hall, library, dining and drawing
rooms, with the state bed-rooms above them; and of these
apartments the hall is the most grand and striking feature,
though of inferior size to that of Clontarf Castle. It is thirty-four
feet long by twenty feet wide, but has an open porch and
vestibule or outer hall, twelve feet six inches wide; and like
every other part of the edifice, its details are throughout in
the purest style of Tudor architecture. This hall is panelled
with oak, and is lighted by one grand stained glass window,
eight feet six inches wide, and fourteen feet six inches high.
This window, which resembles those of the English ecclesiastical
edifices of the fifteenth century, is divided by stone mullions
into four days, or compartments, and being beautifully proportioned,
affords abundant light to the interior. But the
most imposing feature of the hall is its beautiful oak staircase,
which, rising from beneath the window, conducts to a gallery
which crosses the hall, and communicates with the bed-rooms
over the principal apartments. The ceiling is of dark oak,
supported by principals which spring from golden corbels, and
it is enlivened by golden bosses, which are placed at the various
crossings of the rich woodwork, and have a most pleasing effect
from the contrasting relief which they give to its pervading
dark colour. The cornice, which is equally rich and elegantly
proportioned, is surmounted by a gilded crest ornament, which
by its lightness and brilliancy attracts the eye, and leads the
mind to contemplate the fine proportions and elegance of design
which characterises the details of the ceiling in all its parts.</p>

<p>Of the other principal apartments it is only necessary to
state that they are equally well proportioned, and have ceilings
of great richness and beauty, executed in a bold and
masterly style of relief: they are of larger size than the similar
rooms of Clontarf Castle, the library being thirty feet
by seventeen feet six inches, the dining-room thirty feet by
twenty, and the drawing-room thirty-four feet six by twenty.
These apartments are lighted by oriel windows, each of which
commands a view of some striking beauty in the surrounding
scenery. An extensive range of offices and servants’ rooms
branches off the Hall on its western side, but these are as yet
only partly erected, and further additions are still wanting to
carry out the original design of the architect, and give to the
edifice as a whole the intricacy and picturesque variety of outline
which he intended.</p>

<p>Hollybrook was originally the seat of a highly respectable
branch of the Adair family, who, as it is said, though long
located in Scotland, are descended from Maurice Fitzgerald,
fourth Earl of Kildare. By a marriage with the only daughter
of the last proprietor of this family, Forster Adair, Esq.,
it passed into the possession of Sir Robert Hodson, Bart.,
descended of an old English family, and father of the present
proprietor, who succeeded to the baronetcy and estates on the
death of his elder brother the late Sir Robert Adair Hodson,
by whom the new structure of Hollybrook Hall was commenced.
Sir Robert was a gentleman of refined tastes and
intellectual acquirements&mdash;a landscape painter of no small
merit, and of a poetic mind. The present baronet is, we believe,
similarly gifted, and therefore worthy to be the proprietor
and resident of a spot of such interest and beauty;
but he should raze those odious unsightly walls, which exclude
Hollybrook from the eye, and make it an unvisited and almost
unknown solitude.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">TIM CALLAGHAN,<br />
<span class="smaller">THE INIMITABLE PIPER.</span></h2>

<p>Oh! ye whom business or pleasure shall henceforth lead to
the county of Wexford, especially to the baronies of Forth and
Bargie, should you see a tall, stout, lazy-looking fellow, with
sleepy eyes and huge cocked nose, dragging his feet along as
if they were clogs imposed on him by nature to restrain his
motion instead of helping him forward, dawdling along the
highways, or lounging about a public-house, with a green bag
under his arm, beware of him, for that is Tim Callaghan!&mdash;fling
him a sixpence or shilling if you will, but ask him not for
music!</p>

<p>Tim Callaghan seriously assured me “that he sarved seven
long years wid as fine a piper as ever put chanther ondher an
arm;” and that at the end of that well-spent period he began
to enchant the king’s lieges on his own account, master of a
splendid set of pipes, and three whole tunes (<em>barring</em> a few odd
turns here and there which couldn’t be conquered, and of <em>no
consequince</em>), a golden store in his opinion.</p>

<p>“Ah, then, Tim,” said I, when I was perfectly acquainted
with himself and his musical merits, “what a pity that with
your fine taste and superior set of pipes you did not try to conquer
the half dozen at least!”</p>

<p>“Ogh, musha!” quoth Tim, looking sulky and annoyed,
“that same quisthen has been put to me by dozens, an’ I hate
to hear it! It was only yistherday that another lady axt me
that same. ‘Arrah, ma’am,’ ses I, ‘did ye ever play a thune
on the pipes in yer life?’ ‘Niver, indeed,’ ses she, lookin’
ashamed ov her ignorance, as she ought. ‘Bekase if ye did,’
ses I agin, ‘ye’d soon say, “bright was yerself, Tim Callaghan,
to get over the three thunes dacently, widout axin’
people to do what’s onpossible.”’ An’ now I appail to you, Miss,
where’s the use ov bodherin’ people’s brains wid six or seven
whin three does <em>my</em> business as well?”</p>

<p>As in duty bound, I admitted that his argument was unanswerable,
and thenceforward we were the best friends possible.
Grateful for my patience and forbearance, he eternally
mangles the three unfortunates for my gratification; and I
doubt if I could now relish them with their fair proportions, so
accustomed as I have been to Tim’s “short measure!”</p>

<p>After all, Tim Callaghan was a politic fellow; and these
three tunes were expressly chosen and learnt to win the ears
and suffrages of all denominations of Christian men. Thus,
the “Boyne water” is the propitiatory sacrifice at the Protestant’s
door, “Patrick’s Day” at that of the Roman Catholic,
and when he is not sure of the creed of the party he
wishes to conciliate, to suit Quakers, Methodists, Seekers, and
<em>Jumpers</em>, “God save the Queen” is the third. For many
years he was contented to give these favourite airs in their
original purity; but some wicked wight&mdash;a gentleman piper,
I suspect&mdash;has at last persuaded him that his melody would
be altogether irresistible if he would introduce some ornamental
<em>variations</em>, “such as his own fine taste would suggest;”
and poor Tim, unaccustomed to flattery, and wholly unsuspicious
of the jest, caught at the bright idea, conquered his natural
and acquired laziness, and made an attempt. When he
thought he had mastered the difficulties, he did me the honour
to select me as judge to pronounce on his melodious acquisitions;
and all I shall say anent them is, let the blackest hypochondriac
that ever looked wistfully at a marl-hole or his
garters, listen to Tim Callaghan’s “varry-a-shins,” and watch
his face while performing them, and he will require “both
poppy and mandragora to medicine him to sleep,” if sleep he
ever will again for laughing!</p>

<p>When Tim arrives at a gentleman’s door, his usual plan is
to commence with the <em>suitable</em> serenade, and drone away at
that till the few pence he is piping for sends him away content.
But if he is detained long, and he sees no great chance
of reward or entertainment within doors, he becomes furious,
and in his ire he rattles up that one of the three which he supposes
most disagreeable and opposite to the politics of the
offender. If the party be a Roman Catholic, he will be unpleasantly
electrified, and all his antipathies aroused, by “the
Boyne water,” performed with unusual spirit; and if a church-goer,
he will never recover the shock of “Patrick’s Day,”
given with an energy that will render the wound unhealable!
If he is asked for any favourite or fashionable air&mdash;and you
might as well ask Tim Callaghan to repeat a passage of Homer
in the original Greek&mdash;his civilest reply is, “I haven’t
that, but I’ll give yez one as good,” when one of the <em>trio</em> follows
of course; and if the impertinent suitor for novelties in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
his ignorance persists in demanding more than is to be had,
he is angrily cut short, especially if of inferior rank, with
“How bad ye are for sortins! Yer masther wud be contint
wid what I gave ye, an’ thankful into the bargin!” Thus
qualified to please, it is not to be wondered at that he is celebrated
through three baronies as “the piper!”</p>

<p>When first I had the pleasure to see and hear Tim Callaghan,
it was in the middle of winter, dark and dreary, and
in a retired country place, where even the “vile screeching
of the wry-necked fife” would have been welcome in lieu of
better. Conceive our ecstacy, then, when the inspiring drone
of the bagpipe startled our ears into attention and expectation!
The very servants were clamorous in expressing their
delight, and in beseeching that the piper should be brought
into the house and entertained. The petition was granted,
the minstrel was led in “nothing loth,” and seated in the
hall. Well, Tim’s first essay at the <em>minister’s</em> house was of
course “the Boyne,” played very spiritedly and accurately
on the whole, with the exception of a few rather essential notes
that he omitted as unnecessary and troublesome, or (as the
servants supposed) in consequence of the cold of his fingers;
and finally they took him to the kitchen, and seated him opposite
to a blazing fire. “Now he’ll play in airnest!” cried
they, as one and all gathered round him in expectation of
music.</p>

<p>Our piper being now in the lower regions, among the inferior
gentry, and willing to please all orders and conditions, begins
to consider whether he shall repeat the “Boyne,” or commence
the all-enlivening “Patrick’s Day.”</p>

<p>“What <em>religion</em> is the sarvints ov?” replied he at length to
a little cow-boy gaping with wonder at the grand ornaments
of the pipes.</p>

<p>“They are ov all soarts, sur,” whispered Tommy in reply,
and reddening all over at the great man’s especial notice.</p>

<p>“Ov <em>all</em> soarts!” mutters Tim significantly; then deciding
instantly, with much solemnity of face and strength of arm
he squeezed forth the conciliating “God save the King.”</p>

<p>The butler listened awhile with the sapient air of a judge.
“You’re a capitial performer, piper!” said he at length
patronizingly, and with a hand on each hip; “an’ that’s a fine
piece ov <em>Hannibal’s</em> composition! but it is not shutable for all
occashins, an’ a livelier air would agree with our timperament
betther. Change it to somethin’ new.” And tucking his
apron aside, he gallantly took the rosy tips of the housemaid’s
fingers and led her out, while the gardener as politely handed
forth the cook. The piper looked sullen, and still continued
the national anthem as if he knew what he was about, and
was determined to play out his tune. The butler’s dignity
bristled up.</p>

<p>“Railly,” he observed, and smiled superciliously, “we are
very loyal people hereabouts, but at this pertickler moment
we don’t want to join in a prayer for our <em>savren’s</em> welfare!
Stop that melancholic thing, man! an’ give us one of Jackson’s
jigs.”</p>

<p>“Out ov fashin,” quoth Tim sullenly, “<em>but I’ll give yez
one as good</em>,” and “Patrick’s Day” set them all in motion for
a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re quite tired ov that!” at length lisped the housemaid
“do, piper, give us a <em>walse</em> or <em>co-dhreelle</em>. Do you
play ‘Tanty-<em>pol</em>pitty?’ Jem Sidebottom and I used to dance
it beautifully when I lived at Mr A&mdash;&mdash;’s!”</p>

<p>“What does yez call it?” asked Tim rather sneeringly.</p>

<p>“Tanty-<em>pol</em>pitty,” replied the damsel, drawing herself up
with an air enough to kill a piper!</p>

<p>“Phew!” returned the musician contemptuously, “that’s
out ov fashin too; <em>but I’ll give yez one as good</em>;” and the
“Boyne” followed, played neither faster nor slower than he
had been taught it, which was in right time, and any thing
but <em>dancing</em> time, to the no small annoyance of the dancers.
Another and another jig and reel was demanded, and to
all and each Tim Callaghan replied, “I haven’t <em>that, but
I’ll give yez one as good</em>;” and the “King,” the “Boyne,” and
the “Day,” followed each other in due succession.</p>

<p>Was there anything more provoking! There stood four
active, zealous votaries of Terpsichore, with toes pointed and
heads erect, anxiously awaiting a further developement of Tim
Callaghan’s powers! There stood the dancers, looking beseechingly
at the piper; there sat the piper staring at the dancers,
wondering what the deuce they waited for, quite satisfied that
they had got all that could reasonably be expected from <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>“An’ <em>have</em> you nothin’ else in yer chanther?” at last angrily
demanded the butler.</p>

<p>“E&mdash;ah?” drawled Tim Callaghan, as if he did not understand
the querist.</p>

<p>The question was repeated in a higher key.</p>

<p>“Arrah, how bad yez are for sortins!” retorted the piper;
“yer masther wud be contint wid what I gave yez, an’ thankful
into the bargin!”</p>

<p>“By Jupither <em>Amond</em>!” exclaimed he of the white apron,
“this beats all the playin’ I ever heerd in my life! Arrah,
do ye ever attind the nobility’s concerts?&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“’Pon my <em>vo</em>racity,” cried the smiling housemaid, “I am
greatly afeerd he will get ‘piper’s pay&mdash;more kicks than
halfpence.’&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“An’ good enough for him!” added the gardener; “a fella
that has but <em>three half thunes</em> in the world, an’ none ov them
right! Arrah, what’s yer name, avie?”</p>

<p>“What’s that to you?” growled the piper.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothin’! Only I thought that you might be ‘the piper
that played before Moses.’&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh! the world may wag</div>
<div class="verse">Since <em>he</em> got the <em>bag</em>,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>sang the cook, as she returned to her avocations. But the
butler, as master of the ceremonies, showed his disappointment
and displeasure in a summary ejection of the unfortunate minstrel
from the comforts of the fire and the house altogether.</p>

<p>Again I had the exquisite delight of hearing Tim Callaghan.
It was in another part of our county, and where he was quite
a stranger. A lady had assembled a number of young persons
to a sea-side dance one evening; but, alas! ere the hour
of meeting arrived, she had heard that the fiddler she expected
was ill, and could not possibly attend her. What was to be
done? Nothing!</p>

<p>When the guests arrived, and the dire news communicated,
the gentlemen in spite of themselves looked terrifically glum,
as if they anticipated a dull evening; and the bright countenances
of the ladies were overcast, though as usual, sweet
creatures! they tried to look delightful under all visitations.
In this dilemma one of the beaux suddenly recollected that
“he had seen a piper coming into the village that evening;
and he thought it was probable he would stop for the night at
one of the public-houses.” Hope instantly illuminated all
faces, and a messenger was forthwith dispatched for the man
of music. For my part, whenever I heard <em>a piper</em> mentioned,
I knew who was full before me.</p>

<p>“What sort of person is your piper?” asked I of the gentleman
that had introduced the subject.</p>

<p>“A tall, stout, rather drowsy-looking fellow,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried I, “it is the Inimitable!&mdash;it is Tim Callaghan!”</p>

<p>I was eagerly asked if he were a good performer; and as I
could not venture to reply with any degree of gravity, one
other person present, who knew honest Timothy and his ways,
with admirable composure answered, “That under the shield
of Miss Edgeworth’s mighty name he would decline trumpeting
the praises of any one, she having expressly declared in
her novel of ‘Ennui,’ that ‘whoever enters thus announced
appears to disadvantage;’ and therefore,” said my friend, “we
leave Tim Callaghan’s musical merit to speak for itself.” Nothing
could be better than this, and the effect Tim produced
was corresponding.</p>

<p>While the messenger is away for our piper, I must relate an
anecdote of another servant, and a rustic one too, once sent
on a similar errand. John’s master had friends spending the
evening with him, and he desired his servant to procure a musician
for the young folks for love or money. In about half an
hour John returned after a fruitless search; and instead of
saying in the usual style that “he could not find one,” he
flung open the drawing-room door, and announced his unsuccess
in the following impromptu,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> spoken with all due emphasis
and discretion&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I searched the city’s cir-cum-fe-rence round,</div>
<div class="verse">And not a musician is there to be found!</div>
<div class="verse">I fear for music you’ll be at a loss,</div>
<div class="verse">For the fiddler has taken the road to Ross!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and then made his bow and retired. The <em>city</em>, by the way,
was a village of some half-dozen houses. So much for John,
and now for Tim Callaghan.</p>

<p>Presently the identical Tim made his appearance, and was
placed in high state at the top of the room, with a degree of
attention and respect fully due to his abilities. For my part,
the very sight of Tim, and the thought of his consummate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
assurance or stupidity in attempting to play for dancing,
amused me beyond expression; but I suppressed all symptoms
of this, and kept my eyes and ears on the alert in expectation
of what was to follow. A bumper of his favourite punch
was prepared for him, and while sipping it, I thought he cast a
scrutinizing and anxious glance on the company, probably thinking
how he should adjust his <em>politics</em> there. But he had little
time to pause. A quadrille set was immediately formed, and he
was called on to play!&mdash;the sapient belles and beaux never
dreaming that a modern piper even <em>might</em> not play quadrilles.
Never did I find it so difficult to restrain myself from immoderate
laughter! There stood the eight <i lang="fr">elegantes</i>, ringleted,
perfumed, white-gloved, and refined; and there sat Tim Callaghan
in all his native surly stupidity, dreadfully puzzled,
“looking unutterable things,” humming and hawing, and tuning
and droning much longer than necessary&mdash;not in the least
aware of the demand that was to be made on himself or his
pipes, but puzzling his brains as to which of his own he should
play <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>“A quadrille, piper!&mdash;the first of Montague’s!” called out
the leading gentleman.</p>

<p>“E&mdash;ah!” said Tim Callaghan, opening his sleepy eyes, surprised
into some little animation.</p>

<p>“The first of Montague’s set of quadrilles!” repeated the
beau.</p>

<p>“Ogh, <em>Mountycute’s</em> is out ov fashin; <em>but I’ll give yez one as
good</em>;” and the company being mixed, of whose <em>opinions</em> he
could not be sure, the quadrillers were astounded with “God
save the King” in most execrable style!</p>

<p>All stared, and most laughed heartily; but what was of more
consequence to poor Tim, his arm was fiercely seized, and he
was stopt short in the midst of his loyalty by an angry demand
“if he could play <em>no</em> quadrilles? Not &mdash;&mdash; or &mdash;&mdash;?” and the
names of a dozen quadrilles and waltzes were mentioned, that
the unfortunate minstrel had never heard of in all his days and
travels! In his dire extremity be commenced “the Boyne,”
when at the instant some person called the lady of the house.
The name seemed a <em>Catholic</em> one&mdash;a sudden ray of joy shot
through his frame to his fingers’ ends, and from thence to his
pipes, and poor “Patrick’s Day” was the result. A kind of
jigging quadrille was then danced by the least fastidious and
better humoured of the party; the <em>first</em> top couple, superfine
exquisites!&mdash;the lady an importation from London, and odorous
of “Bouquet a-la-Reine,” and the gentleman a perfect
“Pelham,” from the aristocratic arch of his brow to his
shoe-tie&mdash;having retreated to their seats with looks and gestures
of horror and disgust, quite unnoticed by Tim Callaghan,
who bore himself with all the dignity of a household
bard of the olden time, in his element, playing his own favourite
tune, and <em>quollity</em> actually dancing to his music! It <em>was</em>
a great day for the house of Callaghan!</p>

<p>Well! as there seemed nothing better to be had, “Patrick’s
Day” continued in requisition, now as a quadrille, now as a
country-dance, by all who preferred motion to sitting still,
before and after supper, till at last every one was weary of it,
and a general vow was made to drop the “Day” and take the
“Boyne,” and endeavour to move it as we best could. By
that time, too, our piper seemed most heartily tired of his
patron saint, and having quaffed his fourth full-flowing goblet,
appeared to be rather inclined for a doze than to renew his
melody. But he was roused up by our worthy host, who, good,
gay old man! was the very soul of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, piper,” said he, “try to give us something
that we can foot it to! I was not in right mood for dancing
to-night till now. If you be an Irishman, look at the pretty
girl that is to be my partner for the next dance, and perhaps
her eyes may inspire even <em>you</em>, you drowsy fellow, with momentary
animation, and perform a miracle on your pipes!”</p>

<p>Short as this address was, and gaily as it was uttered, it
had no other effect on our piper than administering an additional
soporific.</p>

<p>While the old gentleman was speaking, the drowsy god was
descending faster and faster on Tim Callaghan. He dozed
and was shaken up.</p>

<p>“What does yez want?” growled he at length. “What the
d&mdash;l does yez want?” looking as if he would say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Now my weary lips I close;</div>
<div class="verse">Leave me, leave me to repose.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Music! music!” said our host, laughing. “Any sort of
music, any sort of noise,” and he left the piper and took his
place amongst the dancers.</p>

<p>Tim mechanically fumbled at his pipes, while the gentlemen
busied themselves in procuring partners. There was silence
for some seconds. “Begin, piper,” called out our host.</p>

<p>“Out ov fashin,” muttered Tim in broken half-finished sentences;
“but&mdash;I’ll&mdash;give&mdash;yez&mdash;one&mdash;as&mdash;good&mdash;&mdash;;” and a
long, a loud reverberating <em>snore</em> at the instant made good his
promise of music almost as harmonious as the sounds elicited
from his bagpipe!!</p>

<p>Imagine to yourselves, ye who can, the scene that followed.
The salts-bottle and perfumed handkerchief of the <em>exquisites</em>
were in instant requisition, as if they felt sensations of fainting!
the nervous started as if a pistol went off at their heads,
and those who bore the explosion with fortitude joined in a
chorus of laughter, increased to pain when it was perceived
that the Inimitable, noways disturbed or alarmed, prolonged
his repose, and agreeably to the laws of music, and in excellent
taste, bringing in his <em>nasal</em> performance as a grand <em>finale</em>
to each resounding peal!</p>

<p>“Now,” observed the friend who had answered for me at
a critical crisis, “has not Tim Callaghan made his own panegyric?
Has not his merit spoken for itself? What a figure
our inimitable piper would have cut, had we ushered him in
with a flourish of trumpets!”</p>

<p>When the cachinnatory storm had subsided, and when all
considered that their unrivalled musician had had enough of
slumber, he was once more aroused, to receive his well-earned
guerdon, when the following colloquy commenced:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pray, piper, what is your name?” demanded the master
of the house, with all the gravity of a magistrate on the bench,
and drawing forth his tablets.</p>

<p>“E&mdash;ah? Why, Tim Callaghan.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Tim Callaghan (writing), I shall certainly remember
Tim Callaghan! I suppose, Tim, you are quite celebrated?”</p>

<p>“E&mdash;ah?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are very well known?”</p>

<p>“Why, those that knowed me <em>wanst</em>, knows me agin,” quoth
Tim Callaghan.</p>

<p>“I do believe so! I think I shall know you at all events.
Who taught you to play the pipes?”</p>

<p>“One Tim Hartigan, of the county Clare.”</p>

<p>“Had he much trouble in teaching you?”</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> thrubble! I knows nothin’ ov <em>his</em> thrubble, but faix
I well remimber me own! There is lumps in my head to this
very day, from the onmarciful cracks he used to give it when
I wint asthray.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha! Oh, poor fellow! Well, farewell, Tim
Callaghan!&mdash;pleasant be your path through life; and may
your fame spread through the thirty-two counties of green
Erin, till you die surfeited with glory!”</p>

<p>“Faix, I’d rather be <em>surfeited</em> wid a good dinner!” quoth
Tim Callaghan, and made his exit.</p>

<p>For a couple of years I quite lost sight of Tim, and I began
to fear that he had evanished from the earth altogether “without
leaving a copy;” but, lo! this very summer, that “bright
particular star” appeared unto us again, with a strapping
wife, and a young Timotheus at his heels&mdash;a perfect facsimile
of its father, nose, sleepy eyes, shovel feet and all; and
all subsisting, nay <em>flourishing</em>, on <em>three</em> tunes and their unrivalled
“<em>varry-a-shins</em>!”</p>

and by surgical skill restored to life, though the culprit had
hung the full time prescribed by law. A few nights after,

<h2>LARUS MINUTUS, THE LITTLE GULL.</h2>

<p>This bird, hitherto known in Great Britain only as an occasional
and rare visitant, has now been added to the Fauna of
Ireland&mdash;one of a pair seen between Shannon Harbour and
Shannon Bridge having been shot in the month of May of the
present year, by Walter Boyd, Esq. of the 97th regiment, and
presented by him to the Natural History Society of Dublin.
It has been stuffed by Mr Glennon of Suffolk Street, who continues
to gratify the lovers of natural history by a free inspection
of it.</p>

<p>The Little Gull was first noticed with certainty as a British
bird by Montague, who, in the Supplement to his Ornithological
Dictionary, published in 1813, described an immature specimen,
the plumage being that of the yearling in transition to
its winter garb. The Irish specimen, on the contrary, is
invested with its full summer plumage, as described by Temminck.
The head and upper portion of the neck are black;
the lower portion of the neck and under parts of the body are
white, and at first exhibited a rosy tint, which as is usual
quickly faded after death; rump and tail white; upper parts
pearl grey, the secondaries and quills being tipped with white;
legs and toes bright red; bill of a reddish brown, rather than
of the deep lake of Temminck, or arterial blood-red of Selby;
its length ten inches, or somewhat more than one-half of that of
the blackheaded gull (<i>Larus ridibundus</i>), its nearest congener.</p>

<p>Little has been added to the history of this bird as briefly
given by Temminck as follows:&mdash;“It inhabits the rivers,
lakes, and seas of the eastern countries of Europe; is an occasional
visitant of Holland and Germany; is common in Russia,
Livonia, and Finland; and very rarely wanders to the lakes
of Switzerland. It feeds on insects and worms, and breeds in
the eastern and southern countries.”</p>

<p>In America the Little Gull was noticed on the northern
journey of Sir John Franklin, and it is numbered by Bonaparte
amongst the rarer birds of the United States&mdash;rendering
it probable that the American continent includes also its
breeding habitats. To this we may reasonably add&mdash;considering
the state of plumage of the Irish specimens, the season
of their discovery, the inland locality in which they were seen,
and the analogy in habits between them and the other blackheaded
gulls with which they were associated&mdash;a belief and
hope that the Little Gull will yet be found to breed on some
of the wide expanses of the Shannon, or on the lakes of Roscommon,
Leitrim, and Sligo.</p>

<p>To understand the relation of this gull to the other species
of the same genus, it is necessary that we should take a rapid
survey of the whole family; and happy are we to indulge ourselves
in such mental rambling, as many a gladsome reminiscence
will be awakened both in our own and in our readers’
minds by the mention of these well-known birds. Few indeed
are there who at some period of their lives have not wandered
to the sea-side to enjoy the exhilarating influence of the sea
breeze, and to revel, perchance, on the rich feast of knowledge
which the many strange but admirably formed creatures of
the deep must ever present to the inquiring and contemplative
mind. To them the sea-mew or gull must be familiar, both
in those of the larger species, which are seen heavily winging
their way over the waters, or poised in air, wheeling round to
approach their surface, and in those of lighter and more aërial
form, which, in the words of Wilson, “enliven the prospect
by their airy movements&mdash;now skimming closely over the watery
element, watching the motions of the surges, and now
rising into the higher regions, sporting with the winds;” and
we may surely add, still in the words of that enthusiastic worshipper
of Nature, that “such zealous inquirers must have
found themselves amply compensated for all their toil, by observing
these neat and clean birds coursing along the rivers
and coasts, and by inhaling the invigorating breezes of the
ocean, and listening to the soothing murmurs of its billows.”
Nor could they fail to notice how admirably the white and
grey tints which prevail in the plumage of these birds harmonize
with those of air and ocean&mdash;a species of adaptation which
is manifest in all the works of nature, no colours, however
varied, presenting to the eye an incongruous or disagreeable
picture, and no sounds, however modified by the throats of a
thousand feathered warblers, jarring as discord on the ear.
Well may we judge from this that our senses were framed in
unison with all created objects, and that the right test of excellence
in music, painting, or poetry, is, “that it is natural.”</p>

<p>The genus <i>Larus</i> (Gull) of the early writers included
many birds now separated from it&mdash;the Skuas, or parasitic
gulls; Lestris; the Terns, or sea-swallows; Sterna; and some
others&mdash;the consequence of increasing knowledge in natural
science being the gradual limitation of genera by the use of
more precise and restricted characters. All these genera
now form part of the family of Laridæ, or gull-like birds&mdash;the
system of grouping together those genera which exhibit striking
analogies in plumage or habits securing the advantages of
a natural arrangement, without the danger of that confusion
which so often results from loosely defined genera. The tendency
is indeed to still further subdivision&mdash;the kittiwake
(<i>Larus rissa</i>) having been made the type of a new genus,
Rissa (Stephens), and the blackheaded gulls classed together
as the genus <i>Xema</i> (Boië)&mdash;the periodic change of the colour
of their heads from the white of winter to the black of summer,
their more rapid and tern or swallow-like flight, and their
inland habits, forming so many striking and apparently natural
marks of distinction. To this genus, if finally admitted,
will belong the Little Gull (<i>Xema minuta</i>).</p>

<p>The term <i>Larus</i> is adopted from the Greek, the ancient
Latin name as used by Pliny being <i>Gavia</i>. Brisson (1763)
applies <i>Larus</i> to some of the larger species, and <i>Gavia</i> to a
multitude of others; but there is much confusion in his identifications
of species, and the line of separation was not well
considered. Modern writers also subdivide the gulls, for the
sake of convenience, into two sections&mdash;the larger, or those
varying from nineteen to twenty-six or more inches in length,
the “Goelands” of Temminck; and the smaller, or “Mouettes”
of Temminck. But this system of division is imperfect, as it
veils the remarkable relation existing between many of the
larger and smaller gulls, which should not therefore be separated
from each other. This relation was noticed by some of
the earlier writers. Willoughby designates under the name
<i>Larus cinereus maximus</i> both the herring and the lesser blackbacked
gulls; and under that of <i>Larus cinereus minor</i>, the
common sea-gull. This kind of relation is indeed strikingly
displayed amongst British gulls&mdash;as in the greater and lesser
blackbacked gulls, the Glaucous and Iceland gulls, the herring
and common gulls, and, we may add, the blackheaded
and little gulls; and it is very probable that further research
will show that it exists still more widely.</p>

<p>From Aristotle or Pliny little can be gleaned of the history
of these birds. Aristotle states that the Gaviæ and
Mergi lay two or three eggs on the rock&mdash;the Gaviæ in
summer, the Mergi in the beginning of spring&mdash;hatching the
eggs, but not building in the manner of other birds. Pliny
says that the Gaviæ build on rocks, the Mergi sometimes on
trees; from which remark it appears probable that the genus
<i>Mergus</i> then included not merely the various divers, but also
the cormorants, as was formerly conjectured by Turner.
Whilst, therefore, the ancient Latin name of gull, <i>Gavia</i>,
has been entirely removed from modern nomenclature, the
word Mergus has obtained a signification very limited in comparison
to that which it enjoyed among the ancients, being
now applied to the Mergansers alone, although for a time restored
by Brisson to the Colymbi, which, as possessing the
property of diving in its highest perfection, seem most entitled
to retain it, whilst the term <i>Merganser</i> might be judiciously
applied to the genus now called by some, <i>Mergus</i>, as
was done by Aldrovandus, Willoughby, Brisson, and Stephens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The remarkable differences in the habits of gulls, which
form in part the basis of separation, as suggested by Boië in
the case of the blackheaded gulls, were early noticed. Old
Gesner (1587) says that some gulls dwell about fresh waters,
others about the sea; and from Aristotle, that the grey gull
seeks lakes and rivers, whilst the white gull inhabits the sea.
Every one indeed must have noticed the flocks of gulls which
occasionally appear inland, and share with the rooks and other
corvidæ the rich repast of grubs which is afforded by the
fresh-ploughed land. The common gull (<i>Larus canus</i>) is one
of those which indulge in these terrestrial excursions; but the
blackheaded gulls (<i>Xema</i>) select even the inland marshes as
their breeding-places. The more truly maritime gulls select
islands or rocks, on the surface of which they deposit their
eggs, as the kittiwake the narrow ledges of precipitous cliffs,
the young being reared with safety, where it would seem that
the least movement must plunge them from the giddy height
into the abyss below. This beautiful illustration of the power
of instinct to preserve even the nestling from danger, is admirably
displayed on the northern coast of Mayo, where at
Downpatrick Head the whole face of the perpendicular limestone
cliff is peopled by line above line of gulls, flying, when
disturbed by a stone thrown either from mischievous or curious
hand, in screaming flocks from their eggs or young, and
as quickly settling upon them again, without, as it were, disturbing
the equilibrium of either in a place where to move
would be to tumble into destruction. The clamour of the
kittiwake is indeed so great on such occasions that it has
given rise in the Feroe Islands to a proverb, “noisy as the
Rita in the rocks.” The eggs of several species of gulls are
used as food, being regularly sought for as such on the coast
of Devonshire and other maritime places, but those of the
blackheaded gulls are considered the best, and often substituted
for plover eggs. The flesh of gulls was considered by
the ancients unfit for the food of man; not so by the moderns,
who, though probably no great admirers of it, have not entirely
rejected it. Hence Willoughby tells us (1678) that “the sea-crows
(blackheaded gulls) yearly build and breed at Norbury
in Staffordshire, in an island in the middle of a great pool, in
the grounds of Mr Skrimshew, distant at least 30 miles from
the sea. About the beginning of March hither they come;
about the end of April they build. They lay three, four, or five
eggs of a dirty green colour, spotted with dark brown, two
inches long, of an ounce and half weight, blunter at one end.
The first down of the young is ash-coloured, and spotted with
black. The first feathers on the back, after they are fledged,
are black. When the young are almost come to their full
growth, those entrusted by the lord of the soil drive them
from off the island through the pool, into nets set in the
banks to take them. When they have taken them, they feed
them with the entrails of beasts; and when they are fat, sell
them for fourpence or fivepence a-piece. They take yearly about
one thousand two hundred young ones; whence may be computed
what profit the lord makes of them. About the end of
July they all fly away and leave the island.” And in Feroe,
according to Landt (1798), the flesh of the kittiwake is
not only eaten, but considered “well-tasted.” As pets, gulls
have always on the sea-coast been favourites, Gesner quotes
from Oppian, “That gulls are much attached to man&mdash;familiarly
attend upon him; and, when watching the fishermen,
as they draw their nets and divide the spoil, clamorously
demand their share.” In our own boyish experience we knew
one, poor Tom, which grew up under our care to maturity,
and, unrestrained by any artificial means, flew away and returned
again as inclination impelled it&mdash;recognising and answering
our voice even when flying high in air above. But,
alas! like too many pets, he fell a sacrifice to the loss of that
instinct which would have led him to shun danger. He joined
a crowd of water-fowl on a small lake on the Start Bay Sands.
His companions, alarmed at the approach of the fowler, flew
unharmed away; but poor Tom, with ill-judged confidence,
left the water and walked fearlessly toward the enemy of all
winged creatures, who could not allow even a gull to escape,
and, alas! he was the next moment stretched lifeless on the sand.
Here we shall arrest our pen. Perhaps we have dwelt too
long on this interesting genus of birds, and yet we would hope
that some of our readers may profit by our remarks, and be led
to watch with an inquisitive eye the many animated beings
which surround them, and thus to read in Nature’s never-tiring,
never-exhausted volume, new lessons of wisdom&mdash;new
proofs of the exalted intelligence which has created every
thing perfect and good of its kind.</p>

<p>Some of Oisin’s expressions might justly shock the piety of St Patrick. But
let it be remembered that Oisin is no convert to Christianity; on the contrary,
he is opposed to it, principally because it had put an end to his favourite
pastimes.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">EGYPT AND SYRIA&mdash;MEHEMET ALI.</h2>

<p>The boasted civilization which Mehemet Ali has introduced
into the countries under his sway is entirely superficial, and
has no origin whatever in any real improvement or amelioration
in the condition or for the benefit of their respective populations;
and the reason why a contrary impression has so
generally prevailed amongst late travellers is as follows:&mdash;When
travellers arrive at Alexandria, and more particularly
those of name or rank, they immediately fall into the hands
of a set of clever persons, some of them consuls, who having
either made their fortunes by the Pacha, or having them to
make, leave no effort unemployed to impress them with favourable
opinions of his government. They are then presented
at the Divan, where, instead of a reserved austere-looking
Turk, they find a lively animated old man, who converses
freely and gaily with them, talks openly of his projects
to come, and of his past life, tells them that he is glad to see
them, and that the more travellers that pass through Egypt,
the better he is pleased; that he wishes every act of his government
and institutions to be known and seen, and that the
more they are so, the better will he be appreciated. He then
turns the conversation to some subject personal to them, for
he is always well informed of who and what they are, and
what they know, and at last dismisses them with an injunction
to visit his establishments with care, and to let him know
their opinion of them on their return; and if they happen to
be persons of distinction, he offers them a cavass to accompany
them on their journey. All this is done in a simple
pleasing manner, which can hardly fail to captivate when
coming from so remarkable a man. Instructed by the clique,
and won by the Pacha, they proceed on their journey to
Cairo, where the delusion begun at Alexandria is completed;
for travelling through the country is now easy, and comparatively
safe to what it was, and establishments of various
kinds, such as polytechnic schools, schools of medicine and
general instruction, and manufactories, have been formed in
Cairo and those parts of the country which are most frequently
visited. These are under the direction of foreigners,
chiefly Frenchmen, and are open to those who choose to visit
them; consequently, as the greater proportion of travellers
seek for sights more than instruction, these gentlemen, won
at Alexandria, and delighted at the facility of their journey
from that place, neither turn to the right nor the left from the
beaten track, but, judging of what they do not see by that
which is purposely prepared to be shown them, return to Europe,
and on grounds such as I have above described, and
without looking an inch beneath the surface, proclaim the
Pacha the civilizer and regenerator of Egypt. How far such
is the case, you will be able to judge from what follows, in
which there is no exaggeration. The journey I made extended
up to the second cataract on the Nile, throughout Egypt and
Nubia, and then through Palestine, the whole of Syria, and
the Libanus. I consequently visited very nearly all the countries
under the domination of Mehemet Ali, and as I did not
allow myself to be influenced at Alexandria, and missed no
occasion of informing myself of the state of things whilst on
my journey, I may fairly say that I can give an unbiassed
opinion as to what is going on in that unhappy part of the
world.</p>

<p>In Egypt the whole of the land belongs to the Pacha; besides
himself there is no land-proprietor, and he has the absolute
monopoly of every thing that is grown in the country.
The following is the manner in which it is cultivated:&mdash;Portions
of land are divided out between the fellahs of a village,
according to their numbers; seed, corn, cotton, or other produce,
is given to them; this they sow and reap, and of the
produce seventy-five per cent. is immediately taken to the
Pacha’s depots. The remaining twenty-five per cent. is left
them, with, however, the power to take it at a price fixed by
the Pacha himself, and then resold to them at a higher rate.
This is generally done, and reduces the pittance left them
about five per cent. more; from this they are to pay the capitation
tax, which is not levied according to the real number
of the inhabitants of a village, but according to numbers at
which it is rated in the government books; so that in one instance
with which I was acquainted, a village originally rated
at 200, but reduced by the conscription to 100, and by death
or flight to 40, was still obliged to pay the full capitation;
and when I went there, 26 of the 40 had been just bastinadoed
to extort from them their proportion of the sum claimed.
After the capitation comes the tax on the date-trees, raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
from 30 to 60 paras by the Pacha, and that of 200 piasters
a-year for permission to use their own water-wheels, without
which the lands situated beyond the overflow of the Nile, or
too high for it to reach, would be barren. Then comes an
infinity of taxes on every article of life, even to the cakes of
camels’ dung which the women and children collect and dry
for fuel, and which pay 25 per cent. in kind at the gate of
Cairo and the other towns. Next to the taxes comes the
<i>corvee</i> in the worst form, and in continual action; at any moment
the fellahs are liable to be seized for public works, for
the transport of the baggage of the troops, or to track the
boats of the government or its officers, and this without pay
or reference to the state of their crops.</p>

<p>When Mehemet Ali made his famous canal from Alexandria
to the Nile, he did it by forcibly marching down 150,000 men
from all parts of the country, and obliging them to excavate
with their hands, as tools they had not, or perhaps could not
be provided. The excavation was completed in three months,
but 30,000 men died in the operation. Then comes the curse
of the conscription, which is exercised in a most cruel and
arbitrary manner, without any sort of rule or law to regulate
it. An order is given to the chief of a district to furnish a
certain number of men; these he seizes like wild beasts
wherever he can find them, without distinction or exemption,
the weak as well as the strong, the sick as well as those in
health; and as there is no better road to the Pacha’s favour
than showing great zeal in this branch of the service, he if
possible collects more even than were demanded. These are
chained, marched down to the river, and embarked amidst the
tears and lamentations of their families, who know that they
shall probably never see them again: for change of climate,
bad treatment, and above all, despair, cause a mortality in
the Pacha’s army beyond belief; mutilation is not now considered
an exemption, and the consequence of the system is,
that from Assouan, at the first cataract, to Aleppo, you literally
speaking never see a young man in a village; and such
is the depopulation, that if things continue as they now are
for two years more, and the Pacha insists on keeping up his
army to its present force, it will be utterly impossible for the
crops to be got in, or for any of the operations of agriculture
to be carried on.</p>

<p>The whole of this atrocious system is carried into action by
the cruelest means&mdash;no justice of any sort for the weak, no
security for those who are better off: the bastinado and other
tortures applied on every occasion, and at the arbitrary will
of every servant of the government. In addition to this, the
natives of the country are rarely employed&mdash;never in offices of
trust&mdash;and the whole government is entrusted to Turks. In
short, the worst features of the Mameluke and Turkish rules
are still in active operation; but the method of applying them
is much more ingenious, and the boasted civilization of Mehemet
Ali amounts to this: that being beyond doubt a man of
extraordinary talents, he knows how to bring into play the
resources of the country better than his predecessors did, but
like them entirely for his own interest, and without any reference
to the well-being of the people; and that with the aid of
his European instruments he has, if I may say so, applied the
screw with a master-hand, and squeezed from the wretches
under his sway the very last drop of their blood.</p>

<p>Such is the state of these two countries. Syria is perhaps
the worst off of the two: for the Egyptians used to oppression
bear it without a struggle: whilst the Syrians, who had been
less harshly treated in old times, writhe under and gnaw their
chain.&mdash;<cite>From the Sun newspaper.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Rotation Railway.</span>&mdash;This invention aims at effecting a
complete revolution in the present mode of railway construction
and locomotion. In place of having the ordinary rails
and wheeled carriages, two series of wheels are fixed along
the whole length of the road at about two yards apart, and
at an equal distance from centre to centre of each wheel.
These wheels are connected throughout the whole length of
the line by bands working in grooved pullies keyed on to the
same axle as the wheels, but the axles of one side of the line
are not connected with those of the opposite line. The axles
of the wheels are raised about one foot from the ground; the
top of the wheel, which is proposed to be of 3 feet diameter,
will be therefore elevated 2½ feet above the surface. On
these wheels is placed a strong framing of timber, having an
iron plate fastened on each side in the line of the two series of
wheels. A little within this bearing frame, so as just to clear
the wheels, is a luggage-box or hold, descending to within a
few inches of the ground, in which it is proposed to stow all
heavy commodities, for which purpose it is well adapted,
opening as it does at either end, and its flooring close to the
surface of the ground. At each end of the lower part of the
framing of this luggage-box, are fixed horizontal guide or
friction wheels, working against the supports of the bearing
wheels and pullies, by which arrangement curves will be traversed
with little friction, and it will be impossible for the
framing to quit the track. The framing of timber will be
about 19 feet in length, so that it will rest alternately on six
and eight wheels, but never on less than six. On this framing
the passenger carriages are erected, which, in its progression
forward, it is thought will be kept steady and free from
lateral motion by the weight in the luggage-box, assisted by
the horizontal guide-wheels. Locomotion is produced by putting
the wheels in motion by means of machinery at either
end, which would be effected for an immense distance with a
moderate power, as there would be very little more friction
due to the wheels than that arising from their own weight;
and the frame which bears the carriage would not be run
on to the bearing-wheels until the whole were in motion,
when its weight would act almost after the manner of a fly-wheel,
resting as it would on the periphery of the bearing-wheels.
It will be perceived that by this plan the bearings
of the wheels must be kept perfectly in the direction of the
plane of the road, whether inclined or horizontal; otherwise
serious concussions would occur. But this would not be the
case by the depression of one wheel, or even by its entire removal,
as the framing will be constructed sufficiently stiff as
not to deflect by having the distance of the bearings doubled.
If this plan should be found to answer, it will present
facilities of transport never before thought of, as carriages
might be continually dispatched without a chance of collision,
either by stoppage or from increased speed of the last
beyond the preceding. It also promises to remove the present
great drawback to railway progression, viz. the being able to
surmount but very slight acclivities by locomotive power with
any profitable load; but by the rotative system, inclines may be
surmounted of almost any steepness without the chance of accident.
If a band should break, the action of this railway would
not be impeded, as the power being transmitted from either
end, rotation would take place throughout its whole length,
but the power would not be transmitted from either end past
the disjunction. Even should two bands be destroyed at a
distance from each other and on the same side of the track,
its action would not be destroyed, for although the isolated
portion of wheels would be dead, those on the other side of
the track would be in action, which, with the horizontal guide-wheels,
would move forward the carriage, although, on such
portion, at a diminished speed. Instead of an increased outlay
being required in the formation of railways on this system,
it is estimated that a very considerable saving will be effected,
as a single track will be sufficient, with sidings of dead wheels
at the termination of the several portions into which a long
line would be divided. In crossing valleys, a framing of piles
to support the bearing-wheels would be quite sufficient, and
the road might be left quite open between each line of wheels,
as it would be impossible for the carriage to quit the track,
and therefore no necessity for making a solid road for safety
sake.&mdash;<cite>Civil Engineer and Architect’s Journal.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Magnanimity.</span>&mdash;When the Spanish armies invested Malaga
in 1487, when in possession of the Moors, a circumstance
occurred in a sortie from the city, indicating a trait of character
worth recording. A noble Moor, named Abraher
Zenete, fell in with a number of Spanish children who had
wandered from their quarters. Without injuring them, he
touched them gently with the handle of his lance, saying,
“Get ye gone, varlets, to your mothers.” On being rebuked
by his comrades, who inquired why he had let them escape so
easily, he replied, “Because I saw no beard upon their
chins.” An example of magnanimity (says the Curate of Los
Palacios) truly wonderful in a heathen, and which might have
reflected credit on a Christian hidalgo.&mdash;<cite>Prescott’s History
of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, Boston, 1839.</cite></p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
